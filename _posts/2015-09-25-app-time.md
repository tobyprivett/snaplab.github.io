title: Let's build a native iOS app
---

The web app has been up and running for a few few weeks now and our beta testers are plugging in bits of data. It's all on track, but slow going. The features are complete-ish, so it's now time to think about how to package it for promotion.

I've read plenty about the pros and cons of html5 versus native apps and I've got big dreams for this product, so I'm going to hit the ground running this month with a fresh download of RubyMotion and a four week window.
