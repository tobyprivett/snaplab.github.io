title: Today is a marketing day
---

Today is a marketing day, so the most obvious place to start is with this. A blog post. I anticipate (fear, actually) that there will be many more such days as the burden of labour shifts from the familiar world of step-by-step development towards the lesser known world of marketing.

But the two (and all the other pieces of the pie) are intrinsically linked. So I shall get to grips with today's tasks.

The word I was looking for is *explainer* and there's a whole world of businesses built around building them.
